Description:
This short code demonstrates the steps a programmer should take when solving a problem. 
We are going to solve a common programming exercise called FizzBuzz. 
We have to write a program that enables the user to enter a number, print each number between one and the number the user entered.
The number divisible by 3 will print "Fizz", while the number divisible by 5 will print "Buzz"
For number that is divisible by both 3 and 5, the console will print "FizzBuzz"

Below are the steps demonstrating how we can write such program through writing pseudocode:
	• Step 1: When a user inputs a number
	• Step 2: Loop from 1 to the entered number
	• Step 3: If the current number is divisible by 3, then print "Fizz"
	• Step 4: If the current number is divisible by 5, then print "Buzz"
	• Step 5: If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5, then print "FizzBuzz"
  • Step 6: Otherwise Print the current number.
